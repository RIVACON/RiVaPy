    """Nadaraya-Watson kernel regression with automatic bandwidth selection.
    This implements Nadaraya-Watson kernel regression with (optional) automatic
    bandwith selection of the kernel via leave-one-out cross-validation. Kernel
    regression is a simple non-parametric kernelized technique for learning
    a non-linear relationship between input variable(s) and a target variable.

    Parameters
    ----------
    kernel : string or callable, default="rbf"
        Kernel map to be approximated. A callable should accept two arguments
        and the keyword arguments passed to this object as kernel_params, and
        should return a floating point number.
    gamma : float, default=None
        Gamma parameter for the RBF ("bandwidth"), polynomial,
        exponential chi2 and sigmoid kernels. Interpretation of the default
        value is left to the kernel; see the documentation for
        sklearn.metrics.pairwise. Ignored by other kernels. If a sequence of
        values is given, one of these values is selected which minimizes
        the mean-squared-error of leave-one-out cross-validation.
