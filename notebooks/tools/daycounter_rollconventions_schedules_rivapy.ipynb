    "For different financial instruments such as Bonds or Swaps a vector for certain dates is needed. These vectors are usually called schedules. They may describe the dates where certain payments or other events (such as fixings) occur. Such schedules are normally based on some construction logic such as \"the first Monday of each month in year 2020\". The generation of these schedules is therefore often not handmade but made by algorithms, which we call schedule generators. To create such a schedule with a generator, we have three main ingredients:\n",
    "- Periods describing the frequency of the dates such as monthly, yearly, quarterly etc.\n",
    "- A holiday calendar since most often schedules contain only business days\n",
    "- A roll convention which defines what happens if the algorithm ends at a holiday\n",
